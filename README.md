# Display-channel-number-on-midi-notes
This script serves best as a demonstration of a feature I wish reaper had. 
It will display the midi channel numbers on every midi note in an active miditake. 
Script is only tested on a windows 10 system. 
It should work on all timebase settings, including a docked or undocked midi editor.
If you zoom out alot , the script may become flickery. So know how to use it!
I try to keep itemstatechunk-reading to a minimum. But there might be better ways to create 
scripts like this.
